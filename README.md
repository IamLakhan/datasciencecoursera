Data set used: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Author: Lakhan Gurbani


## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script

### Links to code and code book

CodeBook : https://github.com/IamLakhan/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/CodeBook.md


R script: 
Link : https://github.com/IamLakhan/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/run_analysis.R

This scirpt groups the data sets together and labels it correctly

All you need to do is just run the file and it will save the tidy data set as a text file
